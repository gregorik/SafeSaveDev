SafeSave — Source Control Safety for Unreal Engine
SafeSave is a compact UE editor toolbar that keeps your source control status and unsaved assets impossible to ignore. It reduces risky syncs, prevents lost work, and keeps teams aligned with clear, always‑on signals.

USP & Benefits
🛡️ Always‑On Safety Signals — The toolbar label shows branch/workspace | state at a glance.
👁️ Clear Risk Visibility — Conflicts, Diverged, Behind, Changes, Unsaved, and Login Required are color‑coded.
🧭 Provider‑Aware Actions — Git: Fetch / Pull (Rebase) / Push. Plastic: Update Workspace.
🔒 Safety Gates — Pull/Push/Update are disabled unless the workspace is clean and assets are saved.
🔁 Auto‑Fetch (Git‑Only) — Optional background fetch keeps refs fresh without touching local files.
🔔 Toast Feedback — Optional status‑change toasts keep you informed in full‑screen viewports.
